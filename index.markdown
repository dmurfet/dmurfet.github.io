# Iluka Learning Lab

![Great ocean road](https://outbackfree.imgix.net/content/tours/Grayline/Great_Ocean_Road/064OK_IMGP0415-X2.jpg?w=1740&h=980&fit=crop&crop=center&auto=format)

We work on deep learning, from fundamental mathematical theory through to real-world applications. There is a new industrial revolution on the way, and it is imperative that Australia increases the growth-rate of research and applied expertise in deep learning. To this end we seek to make breakthrough theoretical contributions, publish in the top conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ...) and train *many* Master and PhD students in this quickly emerging field. We hope that some of these students will found companies, providing employment for other mathematicians and contributing to Australian productivity growth through new forms of perceptual and cognitive automation.

We are part of the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Melbourne. We have run a [seminar](http://therisingsea.org/post/seminar-ch/) on deep reinforcement learning and maintain a resource of [deep learning in Australia](https://gist.github.com/dmurfet/072e8503368acdccf32b641f1e800e99). We are looking for highly-motivated students to join our group, at either Masters or PhD level: [apply here](mailto:d.murfet@unimelb.edu.au). You can be interested in anything from the engineering aspect of deep learning, all the way through to the algebraic geometry and statistics of neural networks.

*Iluka is an Aboriginal Australian word meaning: by the sea*

* Susan Wei: statistics, singular learning theory. 
* [Daniel Murfet](http://therisingsea.org/): logic, deep reinforcement learning, singular learning theory. Some relevant papers: [ICLR 2020](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkecJ6VFvr), papers on [linear](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10770) [logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11813).

## Projects

Here are some of the currently active research projects that students might contribute to:

* **GANs everywhere, all the time**: (led by Mingming Gong)

* **Live from the Pareto front:** (led by Susan Wei)

* **Singular learning theory:** (led by Susan Wei, Daniel Murfet) Applications of algebraic geometry and stochastic processes to the development of a foundational theory of deep learning.

* **Reasoning in deep reinforcement learning:** (led by Daniel Murfet) in follow-up work to the [simplicial Transformer](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkecJ6VFvr) we are applying these methods to the study of error correcting codes in the design of topological quantum computers, along the lines of [Sweke et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07207). 

* **Program synthesis in linear logic**: (led by Daniel Murfet) building on a series of [recent](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10770) [papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11813) we are using differential linear logic to lay the foundations a theory of gradient-based program synthesis, also in the context of singular learning theory. This project would involve learning background logic, as well as implementations of logical ideas in Tensorflow or PyTorch.

## Events

In semester two of 2019 we ran a seminar on reasoning in the context of **deep reinforcement learning** with an aim to understand AlphaGo and related breakthroughs, such as AlphaStar. Along the way we looked at deep learning more generally. Some relevant background information:

* [Deep learning in Australia](https://gist.github.com/dmurfet/072e8503368acdccf32b641f1e800e99) a very rough list of researchers in this area.

* [An introduction to deep reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12560.pdf).

* [AlphaGo documentary](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6700846/) on NetFlix.

* [AlphaStar blog post](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/)

There are three main components of AlphaGo: *Monte-Carlo tree search*, *deep learning* and *reinforcement learning*, and we will have talks on all three aspects. One important running theme will be the dichotomy between problems with small and large state spaces, and the corresponding need for function approximation (the successful incorporation of which is what makes AlphaGo scientifically interesting).
