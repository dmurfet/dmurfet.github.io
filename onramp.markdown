# Installing software

You will need the following

  - Python >= 3.7 (on Mac or Windows you might like to install this via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)).
  
This is *much* easier on a Mac or Linux machine than Windows. For Mac or Windows you might want to first install Anaconda. There are two versions of Python, you want >= 3.7. The two major deep learning packages are PyTorch and TensorFlow, we use both depending on the project.

This page contains some references and tools we recommend to new students.

  * Susan uses [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
